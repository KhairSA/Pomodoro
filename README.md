# Pomodoro Technique
Pomodoro application to help with studying. 

The Pomodoro Technique is a popular technique used to help maximize studying efficiency using a combination of methods such as studing, short break, and long breaks.

What is the Pomodoro Techique:
Step 1: start a task and name the studying session
Step 2: study for 25 minutes
Step 3: Take 5 minute break
Step 4: At the 4th studying session take a long instead

The time would then reset and you can continue to study if you want. 

The recent update is set to track your studying time so that you are more familiar with your habits, studying items and dates. This tracking method will help motivate you and keep you consistant.
